# Data-Analysis-Validation-using-Multioutput-Regressor-NNI
This repository is dedicated to hold the colab notebook &amp; python scripts which consists of the data analysis/validation using Multioutput Regressor &amp; NNI

**NNI_1.ipynb & nni_1.py file**: renderes the results of all the models , when the data is not scaled i.e( feature scaling is not applied to the dataset)

**NNI_2.ipynb & nni_2.py file**: renders the reults of all the models , when the data is scaled i.e(feature scaling is applied to the dataset)

**I would also like to point out that this was another problem statement assigned to me , during the assesment of my skills as the role of intern for a company.**

Thank you
